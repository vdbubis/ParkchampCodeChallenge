## Solution for Parkchamp Code Challenge ##

This repository is the implementation of a solution to a Parkchamp Code Challenge for a basic web app using Firebase's real-time database. The project is written in HTML and JavaScript, and is self-contained so that it can be run in any ES6 browser directly from the file. A connection to Firebase is required both to import their libraries and to use the database.
